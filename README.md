# Practice
This repo is where I'll keep my practice sites and tutorial outcomes.

Current project: Angular.js tutorials from Code School. Creating a website for 'Ollivander's Wand Shop'.
Other projects: Going through Codecademy Javascript tutorial to make sure I'm refreshed on the basics. Will be looking at the jquery one next.
