                    <h3>About Georgia</h3>
                    <p>Georgia is a transitional serif typeface designed in 1993 by Matthew Carter and hinted by Tom Rickner for the Microsoft Corporation. It was intended as a serif font that would appear elegant but legible printed small or on low-resolution screens. The font is inspired by Scotch Roman designs of the 19th century and was based on designs for a print typeface in the same style Carter was working on when contacted by Microsoft; this would be released under the name Miller some years later. The typeface's name referred to a tabloid headline claiming "Alien heads found in Georgia."</p>
                    
                    <h3>Design</h3>
                    <p>As a transitional serif design, Georgia shows a number of traditional features of classic serif typefaces, such as alternating thick and thin strokes, ball terminals and an italic taking inspiration from calligraphy. Its figure (numeral) designs are text figures, designed to blend into continuous text; this was at the time a rare feature in computer fonts.</p>

                    <p>Closer inspection, however, shows how Georgia was designed for clarity on a computer monitor even at small sizes: it features a large x-height (tall lower-case letters) and its thin strokes are thicker than would be common on a typeface designed for display use or the higher resolution of print. Its reduced contrast and thickened serifs make it somewhat resemble Clarendon designs from the nineteenth century. It is in its essence a Rational/Modern typeface with bracketing, inspired by Scotch Roman-style typefaces, as is Computer Modern. Speaking in 2013 about the development of Georgia and Miller, Carter said, <blockquote>"I was familiar with Scotch romans, puzzled by the fact that they were once so popular...and then they disappeared completely."</blockquote></p>

                    <p>The Georgia typeface is similar to Times New Roman, another revival of transitional serif designs, but with many subtle differences: Georgia is larger than Times at the same point size, and has a greater x-height at the same actual size; Times New Roman is slightly narrower, with a more vertical axis; and Georgia's serifs are slightly wider and have blunter, flatter ends.</p>

                    <p>Georgia's bold is also unusually bold, almost black. Carter in 2013 commented, <blockquote>"Verdana and Georgia...were all about binary bitmaps: every pixel was on or off, black or white...The bold versions of Verdana and Georgia are bolder than most bolds, because on the screen, at the time we were doing this in the mid-1990s, if the stem wanted to be thicker than one pixel, it could only go to two pixels. That is a bigger jump in weight than is conventional in print series."</blockquote></p>

                    <h3>Screen Readability</h3>
                    <p>Georgia takes the complexity of serifed characters and makes them not only comfortable on-screen, but also very attractive.</p>
                    
                    <p>In large sizes, Georgia might be mistaken for a heavier Times New Roman. It's a sturdy face that could easily be used by any newspaper. On-screen in body-text sizes, it takes on new life--looking friendlier, almost like Cheltenham. The characters are beautifully clear at 8-12 point. Its x-height is larger than Times, but not as large as Verdana's, and the result is a face with a traditional feel that's very pleasant on-screen. It has a true italic that is so fluid and graceful it could be used by itself, and like Verdana, a bold that verges on ultra-bold. The numerals have a slightly old-style feeling but are still lining.</p>

                    <p>Georgia is nothing short of wonderful on-screen--which is, of course, the whole point. It could easily become the de facto serif screen face, and readers would be all the better for it.</p>
